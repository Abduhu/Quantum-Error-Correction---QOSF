# QOSF - Screening Task 2 (Quantum Error Correction)

This project is completed to satisfy the application requirements of QOSF mentorship program. You will find here my solution to Task 2 of the screening tasks.

## Content
+ ''Task2.pdf'' is a theoretical report about the task:
+ ''quantum_error_correction.py'' is the script that includes the answers of each question:

  + You will find functions in the script. Each function is related to a question in the task.
  + I prefered to use **qiskit** package and **aer** simulator to test QC.
